<h1>About Me</h1> 
  <h2>Hi! My name is Kent Kaing. I am a senior at the University of Pittsburgh studying computer science. I am not 100% sure what specific field I want to go in yet but, in the past year, I have been exposed to a lot of web development. 
    By creating this site, I feel that I want to learn more and expand more webdev knowledge.
    <br>
    <br>
    I love listening to music and playing video games. I have recently been listening to Daniel Caesar, Dominic Fike, and Frank Ocean. 
    My current game rotation is Valorant and Monster Hunter. These games are one of the best ways for me to communicate with my friends that I cannot see in person. It also acts as a huge stress reliever as 
    I'm gradutating soon and will have to enter the real world.
